  "description": "The xDai Chain is a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive stable transactions. xDai is used for transactions, payments and fees, and STAKE is used to support Proof-of-Stake consensus. \r\n\r\nxDai is the ideal cryptocurrency for everyday payments and transactions. Fees are extremely low, payments are very fast, and the value remains stable at ~ $1 US Dollar per xDai. User-friendly tools make xDai easily adoptable for crypto and non-crypto users alike! Users only need xDai to complete payments (a single stable token for payments + fees). \r\n\r\nSTAKE is a multi-chain staking token designed to secure the payment layer. Staking allows block producers (validators and their delegators) to provide transaction consensus and receive staking incentives for honest block production. STAKE is not required for everyday chain transactions or users, it is only required for consensus providers. STAKE is also not stable, it is a volatile token whose value is determined by the marketplace.",
