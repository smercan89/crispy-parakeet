    "description": "Digital Reserve Currency was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and a zero inflation rate. It was created during the COVID-19 crisis when fiscal and monetary policies have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the current financial system. The concept of Digital Reserve Currency was developed by Maxim Nurov, founder of Digital Finance, Washington, DC, financial company that specializes exclusively in the digital assets space.\r\n\r\n100% of the DRC token supply has been listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange with an intentionally small market cap to allow early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to DRC if they believe it will have a larger market in the future. The token is fully developed and operational and its holders are immediately able to use it for its intended functionality on the Ethereum blockchain. No one has control over DRC nor provides essential managerial efforts that affect its success as DRC has fully decentralized structure.",
