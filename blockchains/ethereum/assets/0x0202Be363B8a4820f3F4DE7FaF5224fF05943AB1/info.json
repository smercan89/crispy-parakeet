    "description": "The existing DeFi platforms act as a gatekeeper in allowing which projects to be a part of the their pool; thereby barring the majority of assets from participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Multi-asset pools also expose lenders to risk associated with all of the included assets with no control over the collaterals against which their funds can be lent. UniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts.",
