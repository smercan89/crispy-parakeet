    "description": "Nsure is an open insurance platform for Open Finance. The project borrows the idea of Lloydâ€™s London, a market place to trade insurance risks, where premiums are determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model. Capital mining will be implemented to secure capital required to back the risks at any point of time. A 3-phase crowd voting mechanism is used to ensure every claim is handled professionally.",
