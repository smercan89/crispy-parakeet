    "short_description": "Jura Protocol is a paradigm-shifting suite of four technologies that together form the foundation for a robust new blockchain ecosystem. The Jura protocol is feeless, ultrafast, and provides the decentralized security required for users to rest certain that their transactions are safe.",
    "description": "The Jura protocol is essentially a suite of four different innovations all wrapped into one: an individual account-based directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure weâ€™ve named the Fusus, a Proof of Dedication (PoD) consensus mechanism, a dynamically monitored and distributed sharding (DMDS) technique for distributing data, and an AI security and learning layer to prevent malicious attacks from happening",
