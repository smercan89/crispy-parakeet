    Hi! In order to compensate for the efforts of processing PRs, we kindly ask for a contribution.
    Before paying the fee, make sure new tokens fulfill the [acceptance criteria](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863#how-to-get-approved) (there is no fee refund in case of rejection).
    See also the [PR Fee FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset/pr-fee).
    \nPlease pay  **$PAY1_AMOUNT $PAY1_CURRENCY**  with the memo **$PAY1_MEMO**  to the address `$PAY1_ADDRESS`.
    Alternatively, $PAY2_AMOUNT $PAY2_CURRENCY is also accepted (same memo & address).
    \n$QR1_SIMPLE
    \n*Notes*:
    * New tokens without significant usage are rejected, see criteria mentioned above.
    * One PR should be for a single project; PR's with more than 10 logos will be rejected.
    * Trust Wallet Tokens (TWT) are distributed to new users through our [Referral Program](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/invite-a-friend-earn-trust-wallet-token-twt/4125).
    * Payment evaluation happens when there is activity on the PR -- write a comment if you have performed the payment.
    * When payment is detected, an Accept Review is automatically placed on the PR, which is a condition for merge.  The merge is still done manually.

    Fee is PAID, fantastic!  Thanks!
    \nThe PR will be merged soon by a maintainer, and then new/updated logos should be visible in Trust Wallet.
    Please note that the app caches logos for several days, so if you want to see changes immediately, use a new device, or reinstall Trust Wallet (make sure you have a backup of all your wallets first!).  See the [assets FAQ](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets#faq). 
    @zachzwei & @catenocrypt, please take note.
